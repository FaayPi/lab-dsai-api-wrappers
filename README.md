# Lab | API Wrappers

## Introduction

In this lab, you will be contrasting using OpenWeatherMap REST calls directly with calling the pyowm wrapper. 

You will need an [OpenWeather API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/).

Make sure you limit your queries so you don't run queries on a loop. Always loop up limit methods.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and complete each challenge.

## Deliverables

`main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
